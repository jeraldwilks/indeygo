            <h3>And about that name…..</h3>
            <p1>People often ask-how did the name Indeygo come about?</p1>
            <br />
            <p2>
              Well, here’s what unfolded. The recipes were good to go. The
              packaging was dialled. Our production facility was soon to be up
              and running. Everything was in place but the name. We needed one,
              we needed it soon, and we wanted it to be fun and catchy.
            </p2>
            <br />
            <p3>
              Lisa figured the best way to do this was to get her friends with
              creative minds to help out. She decided that the best way to aid
              in the creative thinking process was a quick stop to the local
              beer store. Some fine Canadian brew was purchased, friend’s
              glasses were filled and the dialogue started. A half hour later a
              discussion around the favourite colour of blue started (aka
              indigo) which morphed into in..di..go…….in..dey..go….. to
              in-dey-go into the oven!

            <h3>Giving Back</h3>
            <p1>
              At Indeygo, one measure of our success is our ability to support
              community groups. Every year we donate 1% of our sales to
              non-profit organizations we care about. To date, we are proud to
              say we have donated over $100,000 to a variety of non-profits;
              environmental groups, animal rescue organizations, along with
              women’s and children’s charities.
